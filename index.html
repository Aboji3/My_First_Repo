        <h2> A Brief History on the "Justice Gundam"</h2>
        <p>In mid CE 71, ZAFT created a series of advanced mobile suits based on 
          technology reverse-engineered from the captured Earth Alliance G Project suits. 
          One of these mobile suits is the ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam, 
          which can be considered the sister unit of the ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam. Most of the Justice's
          and Freedom's weapon systems were tested on the YFX-600R GuAIZ Experimental Firearms Type.</p>
        <p>Late in CE 71, Athrun Zala, former pilot of the GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam, 
          was assigned the Justice with the mission to either recapture or destroy the stolen Freedom. 
          Instead, Athrun joins forces with the Freedom's pilot, his old friend Kira Yamato, 
          in defending the neutral nation of Orb Union from Earth Alliance's attacks. 
          Later Athrun met up with the support vessel FFMH-Y101 Eternal which carried two METEOR units.</p>
         <p>Athrun and Kira used the METEORs' firepower to thwart an Earth Alliance nuclear missile attack on the PLANTs on the final day of the war, 
            and Athrun also destroyed the GAT-X131 Calamity Gundam with his METEOR's beam sword. 
            Afterward, Athrun flew the Justice inside the gamma ray laser GENESIS and activated the Gundam's self destruct system, 
            preventing his father's doomsday weapon from firing on the Earth. 
            Two years later, the Justice's successor, 
            the ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice Gundam was built and again piloted by Athrun.</p>
